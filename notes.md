GIT Verbs
------------
FORK + CLONE
    FORKING is making a copy, still owned by someone else
    CLONING is saving a copy on your local computer (in case you need to work offline)

COMMIT
    It's like a checkpoint. You can always go back to it. Saves on your local machine.

PUSH + PULL
    PUSH to send to server
    PULL to take a copy from the cloud

BRANCH
    Like FORKING, but your own copy on your computer
    It can be merged back

MERGE + REBASE + SQUASH


Ecosystem
------------
Engineers who specialize in machine learning and statistics, or dealing with tons of data, are different than engineers who specialize in optimizing apps for low internet connectivity conditions, limited device capabilities, in disaster conditions, for example.

Front End  - visuals, feel, user interaction, device type
Back End - the inner mechanics: security, databases (graph-based, document storage, or relational database), logic, AI/ML, APIs

A great deal of specialization when it comes to apps and devices

User Interface (UI) - design aspects: color, placement, "interior decorator"
User Experience - how user interacts with app, or most appropriate venue
